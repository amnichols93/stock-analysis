## 2017
In 2017, all tickers except one (TERP), had positive net returns. The ticker with the highest return percentage was DQ (199.4%), followed closely by SEDG (184.5%).
## 2018
In 2018, the only tickers with a positive return were ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84.0%). The ticker with the most negative return was DQ (62.6%).
## Analysis
For every ticker except TERP, 2017 yielded a greater return percentage. Steve's initial purpose for this analysis was to help advise his parents on whether they should invest in DQ. DQ swung from the highest return in 2017 to the lowest return in 2018. Given only the data from these two years, it is unclear if DQ has a history of drastic fluctuation or if DQ has suffered a consistant decline. With only data from 2017 to 2018, DQ does not appear to be a promising investment. If Steve's parents are looking for which other ticker would be a better investment, the two tickers that survived 2018's overall mass decline were ENPH and RUN. ENPH has a higher Total Daily Volume (ENPH: 607,473,500; RUN: 502,757,100), while RUN has a higher Return Percentage (RUN 84.0%; ENPH 81.9%).


Ultimately, I think this data is insufficient to provide an accurate analysis for a potential investor to make an informed decision, and I recommend gathering data from at least 2016 and 2019 before offering a recommendation.
